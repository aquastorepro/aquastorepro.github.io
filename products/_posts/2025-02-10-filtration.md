### Introduction

La filtration est l'un des plus importants aspects de l'aquariophilie. Dans cet article, on va explorer les differents types de filtrations qui existent et mettre au point une filtration pour notre aquarium standard de 60 litres.


### Overview

Avoir vos paramètres d'eau en équilibre est le premier pas vers un processus d'aquariophilie réussi. En principe, la filtration est assez simple (de l'eau sale en entrée passe par un filtre et ressort en eau propre), elle est en fait un processus compliqué qui repose sur plusieurs étapes et microorganismes. Heureusement, vous pouvez mettre en place une assez bonne filtration sans trop rentrer dans l'aspect scientifique de cette dernière.

Au niveau conceptuel, votre eau sale doit passez par une serie de stages de filtrations qui utilisent différent types de média et d'outils.

Trois stages ou étapes de filtration sont à attendre :  

1. <ins>Filtration méchanique</ins>, qui nettoie votre eau des grandes à petites particules, comme les détritus, l'exès de nourritures et les fines particules en suspensions dans l'eau.
2. <ins>Filtration biologique</ins>, qui est produite par les bactéries bénéfiques responsables de la conversion de l'azote (la susbstance toxique qui entre dans votre aquarium suite à la décomposition de la nourriture, des plantes, des déchets de vos poissons, etc...) vers d'autres composants comme les nitrites et les nitrates.
3. <ins>Filtration chimique</ins> qui est responsable de l'élimination des composés chimiques présents dans l'eau comme les médicaments et les tanins.

Ce qui résulte des ces trois étapes de filtration doit être éliminé de votrre aquarium par le biais de plantes et à travers les changements d'eau.

> La filtration chimique est généralement faite avec des produits comme le charbon actif et la zeolite. Cependant, le niveau d'éfficacité des produits disponibles sur le marché pour enlever les composants chimiques reste discutable. Il faut toujours se renseigner sur internet avant d'acheter ce types de produits.

Le média responsable pour la filtration biologique doit être spécifiquement conçu pour abriter le plus grand nombre de bactéries bénéfiques possible. En effet, il doit avoir une grande surface à coloniser par les bactéries. Plus grande est la surface, meilleur est la filtration; puisque plus de bactéries peuvent s'y abriter. Par exemple, la roche volcanique (pouzzolane) dans la photo en dessous est très populaire dans le hobby à cause de sa nature poreuse, ce qui lui confère une grande surface par rapport à son volume.

> More pores = more surface area => more beneficial bacteria => better filtration.

More biological media does not always equate better filtration. Indeed, if you have a small fish load (your dirty input is small) then adding more surface area does nothing, because the colonies of bacteria are relative to the load. If you have 1M bacteria for example, and your water parameters and fish load are stable, then adding more media will not host more beneficial bacteria (they will have nothing more to eat). Your bacteria population will remain at 1M. On the flip side, not having enough media for a given load will cause your tank to crash and you will have an ammonia spike.

Mechanical filtration is usually done with media like sponges, filter socks, pot scrubbers, and filter floss. 

Manufacturers tend to combine different media to provide the three stages of filtration into a single product.

**Types of filtration**

Different types of filtration can occur depending on your setup and the level of oxygen available :

1. Anoxic :  occurs in the absence or limited amounts of oxygen. Here, microorganisms relay on the availability of nitrates and nitrites to oxidize organic matter. This type of filtration can occur in an aquarium with a deep substrate.
2. Anaerobic : occurs in the absence of oxygen. Here, microorganisms breakdown organic matter into methane, carbon dioxide, and biomass.
3. Aerobic : occurs in an oxygenated environment. Here, microorganisms consume oxygen to oxidize pollutants. This is typically the environment you will find in most aquariums.

The three levels can be combined to achieve proper water treatment. These filtration methods are primarily used in water treatment facilities but their science
can serve as an inspiration to built filtration mechanisms for ornamental fish.

### Types of filters

The following is a small list of the different types of filters you can find on the market.

**Undergravel filter**

![Undergravel filter plates](/assets/img/1739370179638.jpg)
*Undergravel filter plates*

The set it and forget about it filter. Perfect for shrimp and fish breeding, an undergravel filter is composed of a single or multiple plates and a lift tube. The plates are placed at the bottom of the tank with a layer of gravel on top of them.

The filter works by creating a lift of water using an air stone or a power head attached to the lift tube. As water is sucked from underneath the gravel, it is filtered by the gravel and the beneficial bacteria it hosts.

An undergravel filter will catch a great amount of waste and particles but its effectiveness may be reduced over time if not cleaned. You will have to clean it every few months (some people report years), which is always good as you can allocate your time to do something else. 

The problem with this type of filter is you have to take everything apart to do the cleaning, although you can gravel vacume the substrate. Another inconvenience is that fish that dig up the substrate, like convict cichlid for example, will compromise the integrity of the filter rendering it non operational.

> The undergravel filter has been somewhat 'forgotten' and replaced by other means of filtration. It is however a cheap and reliable way of achieving a full cycle in your tank.

**Gravel filter**

The gravel filter has the same benefits as the undergravel filter without the downsides. It is basically a box filter with only gravel in it. Easy to clean and maintain and, like the box filter, can be built fairly cheaply.

**Box Filter**

*A DIY version of the infamous box filter*

A box filter is a box with a lift tube. You can fill the box with filter media topped with filter floss or a sponge. The water is sucked from beneath or from the top of the filter (see picture above), passes through the filter media then exists through the lift tube. The box filter is very popular amongst hardcore aquarists for its simplicity and versatility.

**Sponge filter**

*Sponge filter*

Sponge filter is a good example of both mechanical and biological filtration. It is easy to setup, maintain and clean. Sponge filters tend to clog over time but its fairly easy to unclog them.

**Internal filter**

![Internal filter](/assets/img/1739445302074.jpg)
*Disassembled internal filter*

The internal filter is the standard filter you can buy for your tank. They come in a variety of sizes, usually in a rectangular shape. Some have many compartments where you can put different types of media.

> Prefer to buy an internal filter with adjustable speed so that it can be used in different tank sizes without a problem.

**Hang on back filter**

The HOB filter is a box that you hang on your tank. It has an inlet tube that pumps water from your tank. The water gets filtered by the cartridges and media then flows back to the tank. It is easy to use and maintain but its downside is you can't properly cover the tank. You have to custom cut a lid for the tank to do that.

The HOB filter is the way to go if you want to do an aquascaping tank. It gives you clear access to all your tank, which makes plant maintenance easier.

>Instead of using the provided cartridges, replace them with a sponge and filter media like lava rock or the provided media. That way, you have the same benefits and you save money not buying new cartridges every now and then. 
>
>Another great tip is to add a sponge n the filter's intake. This prevents things from getting into the propeller and adds more surface area for the beneficial bacteria.

**Canister filter**

A canister filter is basically a sealable box with multiple trays, an input flow and and output flow. In each tray of the filter you can put different types of media. The water is sucked from the aquarium through the input flow, goes to to bottom of the canister using a tube, then raises through every tray of the filter to be finally expelled and returned to the aquarium. The canister filter is a very popular choice amongst aquarists but they sometimes lose their seal which makes them leak.

**Sump filter**

![Sump filter](/assets/img/Sump-Filter.jpg)
*Sump filter*

A sump is a container divided into multiple chambers. Each chamber plays a role in the filtration. Usually a sump is placed under an aquarium. It receives water from the main aquarium using an overflow system. The water then travels from chamber to chamber to be filtered. From the last chamber, it is returned to the main aquarium using a pump. Sump filters can be external or integrated into the main aquarium (internal). 

**No filter**

The no filter 'movement' is based on the premise that you establish a stable ecosystem in your tank between fish, microorganisms and plants. Usually, this is a heavily planted aquarium with a deep substrate and nano fish like endlers or neon tetras.


### Filtering a 20 gallons aquarium

A 20 gallons aquarium is the perfect size to start fishkeeping. It is big enough for small fish and small enough that you can put it everywhere.

To filter the tank, you first need to specify what you want to do with it :
Do you want to setup a natural aquarium? A breeding project? An aquascaping tank? Or maybe you want to keep some shrimp ?

If you want to use the tank for breeding fish, say [molly fish](https://tmaquaponics.github.io/2025/02/08/molly-fish.html){:target="_blank"}, then we suggest the following options :

1. A bare bottom tank with a sponge or box filter : no substrate means the tank is easier to clean. However, you will get particles floating around in the water all the time (the fish will constantly stir up detritus that collects at the bottom) and the sponge filter will get dirty quicker. A gravel bottom will collect fish waste and your sponge filter will remain operational for a longer period of time before requiring any cleaning. But, you will also have to clean the gravel from time to time.
2. An undergravel filter.
3. A HOB filter. It is easy to setup and clean, and you have access to all the corners of your tank. For our use case, it can be used as a complementary filtration in case you want to stock up the tank.

> You can combine an undergravel filter with a sponge or HOB filter to get the benefits of both.

**Seeding and cycling your tank** 

Seeding and cycling are a common practice in the hobby when setting up a new aquarium. It takes about a month for the beneficial bacteria to colonize your tank and media. What we want is to take some media from an established tank to jump start that process and reduce the time before we can put fish in our tank.

You can seed and aquarium using different methods :

4. Squeezing a dirty sponge filter into your water.
5. Using colonized media from another tank.
6. Using bottled bacteria products.
